1) Managing Customers in Elixire Summary: This article explains how to view and manage customer details, purchase history, and customer-ledger actions in Elixire. It covers how to find a customer, review their purchase history and quantities, add quantities for repeat purchases, and inspect/record payments and credits. How to use Manage Customers Open the Manage Customers view Click the Manage Customers icon in the left navigation bar. Locate a customer Enter the customer’s contact number in the search field. As you type, Elixire suggests matching numbers. Click the correct number from the suggestion list to open that customer’s record. Review profile and contact details The top area of the customer screen shows profile/contact information. Edit contact details here when required. Review purchase history and SKU details Use the first tab (Purchase/Items tab) to see all SKUs the customer has bought, the dates and quantities. To re-sell a previously purchased item, locate the SKU in the history, confirm the available quantity, and add the required quantity to the current sale. Review transactions and ledger (payments/credits) The Ledger / Transactions tab shows all transactions and payments associated with the customer. Use this to check whether any credit is pending and to identify the specific transaction(s) that created the pending balance. Record payments or adjustments From the ledger view you can record received payments or adjustments and update the customer’s outstanding balance accordingly.

2) Managing SKUs in Elixire Summary: This article explains the Manage SKU area: how Elixire stores a large preloaded SKU database, how SKUs are listed and searched, and how to create and save store-specific SKU details. How to view and create SKUs Open Manage SKU Click the Manage SKU tab (fifth icon on the left navigation bar). Browse existing SKUs Elixire ships with a very large preloaded SKU database (more than 500,000 SKUs). SKUs are listed alphabetically and can be scrolled or searched. Create a new SKU Click the plus (+) icon and select Create SKU. Fill the SKU creation form (name, packaging/pack size, MRP, HSN code and other product attributes). Many SKU fields are store-specific; these values are saved per store. Save and use Save the SKU; it will be available for selling, purchasing, and inventory management in that store. Notes: Store-specific fields ensure you can maintain different details per store (for example different pack sizes or local pricing).

3) AI-generated Purchase List (Elixire AI) Summary: Elixire’s AI engine generates an optimized purchase list to reduce stockouts and minimize expiry-related losses. This helps pharmacies buy optimal quantities so customers are served and expiry waste is reduced. How the AI purchase list works Purpose The AI creates an optimal purchase list so the pharmacy buys sufficient stock to avoid stockouts without over-ordering (which causes expiries). Benefits Reduces missed sales due to unavailable products. Reduces losses from expired stock by preventing over-purchasing. Ensures popular products are available in the right quantities. Usage The AI-generated list is presented to the pharmacist who can review and use it while placing purchase orders.

4) Sales Transactions — Sales Screen and Workflow Summary: This article describes the Sales screen in Elixire, how to create a sale, search and select batches, use alternative suggestions and icons, process payment (including partial payments and credit), and generate/share invoices. Sales screen overview Layout The Sales screen is split into two main sections. The left section is used to create sales transactions; the right section lists transactions for the selected day by default. View historical transactions Click the Calendar icon to navigate to past dates and view transactions for any day or month. Creating a sale Search and select a product Start typing the product name or code in the product cell. Elixire suggests matching products and batches. When product batches appear, Elixire lists batches ordered by nearest expiry first (FIFO-by-expiry behavior) to reduce expiry risk. Review alternative suggestions and icons Elixire may display alternative products with icons that indicate: Icon 1 (green highlight): the alternative is more profitable for the pharmacist. Icon 2: the alternative is cheaper for the customer. Icon 3: inventory is available in-store. Icon 4: the alternative will expire in the next few months (expiry warning). Use this information to choose an alternative that balances customer needs and inventory goals. Quantity selection and expiry-aware choices Select the batch and quantity. The system defaults to batches near expiry so pharmacists can push expiring inventory where appropriate. Payments and invoicing Payment modes Enter payment amounts and choose a payment mode (cash, UPI, card, or combinations). Elixire validates amounts: overpayment/underpayment will be flagged. If the customer pays less than the full amount, you may put the remaining amount on credit; the outstanding amount will be recorded in the customer ledger. Finalize sale and invoice actions Submit the sale to generate the invoice. You may create a PDF of the invoice and share it with the customer directly from the UI. Revenue vs Collection (important distinction) Revenue = total sales value for the day (what was sold), regardless of whether payment was received. Collection = actual cash/receipts received on that day. Having both metrics helps reconcile sales activity with cash flow.

5) AI Upload of Purchase Invoices (Bulk Upload from Scanned Invoices) Summary: This article explains how Elixire’s AI upload feature parses scanned or photographed purchase invoices and creates purchase drafts ready for review — enabling fast bulk upload even for invoices with hundreds of items. How AI Upload works Uploading invoices Upload scanned purchase invoice images or PDF files to the AI Upload area. Elixire’s AI parses the invoice to extract invoice number, date, supplier, and line items. Draft creation and notification After processing, Elixire creates a Purchase Draft and notifies the user (for example: “Purchase draft of invoice number SB24 49348 is ready for review”). Review and correction Open the Purchase Draft. The extracted invoice fields and line items will be displayed. Review the parsed SKUs, quantities, rates, discounts, and HSN codes. Correct any mismatches or unrecognized SKUs (map supplier SKUs to your store SKUs if necessary). Submit to inventory After review, click Submit. The invoice will be pushed into Elixire and inventory quantities will be updated. Notes: AI upload significantly reduces manual entry time for large invoices (hundreds of items). Always review the draft to ensure SKU mapping and discount fields are correct before submitting.

6) Adding a Supplier in Elixire Summary: This article describes how to add/register a new supplier when uploading a purchase invoice — by entering the supplier GSTN and completing the supplier registration form. How to add a supplier Trigger supplier registration during purchase upload When uploading a purchase invoice, enter the supplier’s GSTN number. If the supplier is not already in Elixire, the system presents a supplier registration form. Fill required fields Complete all required fields (those marked with an asterisk). Note: the transcript contained an unclear token (“estri”) in the supplier-form context; this is referenced as [INAUDIBLE: estri] in the original transcript — in practice, this corresponds to fields marked as required/mandatory. Submit and save Submit the form. The supplier will be registered in Elixire and available for future invoices — there is no need to register the same supplier again.

7) Supplier & Purchase Management (Outstanding Invoices and Payments) Summary: This article explains the Manage Purchase view in Elixire: how to view uploaded invoices by date, list and review outstanding supplier payments, and record payments against invoices. How to manage supplier invoices and payments Open Manage Purchase / Supplier management In the Manage Purchase area you can see all invoices uploaded for selected dates.

Record payment for an invoice Select an invoice → click Record Payment (or the equivalent payment option). Enter: invoice being paid, amount paid, payment mode, and payment date. Save the payment. The outstanding balance will be updated. View supplier details and pending invoices Click into a supplier to see all pending invoices, total outstanding amount, and items bought under each invoice. From inside the supplier view you can also add a new supplier or update amounts/payments.

In practice, use the “update amount” or “record payment” fields in the supplier UI to adjust balances.

8) Uploading a Purchase Invoice from Excel in Elixire Summary: This article explains how to upload supplier purchase invoices into Elixire using an Excel file. It covers creating a purchase format, mapping invoice fields, handling file format issues, and ensuring accurate SKU and discount mapping. Steps to Upload a Purchase Invoice from Excel 1. Check or Create a Purchase Format Before uploading, verify whether a purchase format exists for the supplier. If it does not exist: Enter the supplier’s GSTN number. The supplier’s name will auto-populate. Specify the row number where invoice data begins. For example, if the first row contains column headers and data starts in row 2, enter “2.” Assign a name to the purchase format (e.g., the supplier’s name). Map Excel columns to Elixire fields: Field Column SKU Name B Packing C Batch Number N Expiry Date O Quantity E Free Quantity F MRP K Rate I Discount T SGST AA CGST AB IGST AC HSN Code AE Specify expiry date format as DD-MM-YYYY. Save the format. It will remain available for future invoices from the same supplier. 2. Upload the Invoice File Select the supplier’s Excel file. Ensure the file format is .xlsx (Elixire does not support .xls). If the file is in .xls, use Save As → Excel Workbook (.xlsx) in Microsoft Excel. After selecting the file, click Process File. 3. Verify and Map SKU Names SKUs from the supplier’s file may not match Elixire’s product database. For each SKU: Search and select the correct SKU from Elixire. Suggestions will be provided based on name and pack size. 4. Enter Sales Discounts For each SKU, enter: Discount for regular customers. Discount for premium customers. Repeat for all rows in the invoice. 5. Partial Invoice Upload (Optional) Elixire supports uploading a single invoice in multiple parts.

This is useful when urgent SKUs need to be added quickly before a sale. 6. Finalize the Invoice Enter the Supplier Invoice Number and Invoice Date. Click Submit. Confirm the SKUs are uploaded successfully. Example: In Check Inventory, you should see the new SKU entry with purchase date, supplier, and quantity.

Define Sales Discounts Elixire supports two customer categories: Regular Customers Premium Customers For each SKU: Enter the maximum discount allowed for both customer types. These values set the minimum selling price at checkout, ensuring the pharmacy’s margin is protected. Example: Regular customers: 10% discount → minimum selling price ₹81. Premium customers: 15% discount → minimum selling price ₹76.5. 4. Example: Adding Another SKU Enter product name (e.g., Crossin). System fetches pack, HSN, and GST automatically. Enter batch, expiry, quantities, MRP, and purchase rate. Define discounts, including cutting/tablet-level discounts (useful for medicines sold by splitting strips). Example discount setup: Regular customer (full strip): 10% Regular customer (tablet/cut strip): 0% Premium customer (cut strip): 5% Premium customer (full strip): 15% 5. Submit and Verify Submit the invoice once all SKUs are added. The invoice will be uploaded and reflected in the Dashboard with purchase value and outstanding balance.
