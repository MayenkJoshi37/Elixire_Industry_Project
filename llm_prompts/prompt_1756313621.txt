    8) Uploading a Purchase Invoice from Excel in Elixire Summary: This article explains how to upload supplier purchase invoices into Elixire using an Excel file. It covers creating a purchase format, mapping invoice fields, handling file format issues, and ensuring accurate SKU and discount mapping. Steps to Upload a Purchase Invoice from Excel 1. Check or Create a Purchase Format Before uploading, verify whether a purchase format exists for the supplier. If it does not exist: Enter the supplier’s GSTN number. The supplier’s name will auto-populate. Specify the row number where invoice data begins. For example, if the first row contains column headers and data starts in row 2, enter “2.” Assign a name to the purchase format (e.g., the supplier’s name). Map Excel columns to Elixire fields: Field Column SKU Name B Packing C Batch Number N Expiry Date O Quantity E Free Quantity F MRP K Rate I Discount T SGST AA CGST AB IGST AC HSN Code AE Specify expiry date format as DD-MM-YYYY. Save the format. It will remain available for future invoices from the same supplier. 2. Upload the Invoice File Select the supplier’s Excel file. Ensure the file format is .xlsx (Elixire does not support .xls). If the file is in .xls, use Save As → Excel Workbook (.xlsx) in Microsoft Excel. After selecting the file, click Process File. 3. Verify and Map SKU Names SKUs from the supplier’s file may not match Elixire’s product database. For each SKU: Search and select the correct SKU from Elixire. Suggestions will be provided based on name and pack size. 4. Enter Sales Discounts For each SKU, enter: Discount for regular customers. Discount for premium customers. Repeat for all rows in the invoice. 5. Partial Invoice Upload (Optional) Elixire supports uploading a single invoice in multiple parts. If only part of the invoice is uploaded, the system ensures: No duplicate SKUs are re-uploaded. Remaining items can be uploaded later. This is useful when urgent SKUs need to be added quickly before a sale. 6. Finalize the Invoice Enter the Supplier Invoice Number and Invoice Date. Click Submit. Confirm the SKUs are uploaded successfully. Example: In Check Inventory, you should see the new SKU entry with purchase date, supplier, and quantity. The purchase invoice has now been uploaded successfully into Elixire.

10) Purchase Upload Options in Elixire Summary: This article explains the four methods available in Elixire to upload purchase invoices. Depending on the supplier’s format and the pharmacist’s workflow, invoices can be entered manually, uploaded via Excel, processed using AI, or partially uploaded after sales. 1. Manual Entry Create a purchase invoice and enter all product details manually. Suitable for pharmacists who do not have supplier-provided digital files. 2. Excel Upload Many suppliers provide invoices in Excel format. These files can be directly uploaded into Elixire after setting up a purchase format to map invoice fields. Recommended when suppliers consistently provide digital Excel invoices. 3. AI Upload (Email with Photo) Elixire supports AI-powered invoice processing. Process: Take a clear photograph of the purchase invoice. Email it to the designated Elixire address. Within 5 minutes, the invoice data is uploaded into the Create Purchase Invoice screen. Pharmacist reviews and verifies details before final upload. This is the fastest and most automated option. 4. Partial Upload (After Sales) Used when some SKUs from an invoice must be uploaded immediately because sales have already occurred. Allows partial entry of an invoice without duplication when the remaining items are uploaded later. Elixire provides flexibility in purchase entry, allowing pharmacists to choose the most convenient method depending on supplier practices and business needs.
